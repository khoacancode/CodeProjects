# CodeProjects

Angular4App:
- Angular 4 web application generated with Angular CLI.
- Webpack for project configuration/build
- Touched how to create components, inject and consume services, set page routing,

Sept 25th: Added an Ionic App
-App displays reddit entries with settings options to switch categoy and number of posts limit.
    -- Used basic ionic components (ion-button, -icon, -card, sub-component and associated atrributes
    -- consumed reddits api json call
    -- passing data (selected reddit post) to different page (listing -> details view)
    -- localstorage as a helper to keep shared data (category and numberof posts)
-Todos/Enhancements:
    -- mess around with more ionic conponents, sub-components, components' associated data and event attributes etc... 
    -- experiment with the styling by adding/editing sass files, explore/discover inconsistency (if any) ionic sass and browser's styling.
    -- check out different templates other than the default 3 tabs
    -- refactoring code: DRY- bring getDefaults() into a service and inject it back to where needed.
